# SkillStorm Project 3
For this project, you will be working with a team to build a full-stack application that allows a company to manage and view the inventory of its warehouses. The project will be built using Spring, MySQL, Angular, and coding best practices. The application should provide a pleasant and easy to use user interface for a manager to come in and manage different company warehouses. The application must provide the manager with the ability to create new warehouses, add items to existing warehouses, and update/delete items from existing warehouses. These warehouses have a maximum total capacity for items that it can store and should not allow the addition of an item if it will cause the warehouse to exceed its total capacity.

## UI Requirements:

### Main Page
- [ ] List the company's name prominently on the webpage
- [ ] Contains a section showcasing all of the company's warehouses

### Warehouse Page
- [ ] Displays information about the warehouse such as its total capacity
- [ ] Displays all of the items currently being stored in that warehouse
- [ ] Feature for adding a new item to the warehouse
- [ ] Feature for deleting an existing item from the warehouse
- [ ] Feature for updating an existing item in the warehouse
- [ ] Contains a link to navigate back to the home page

### General
- [ ] Your website should maintain thematic consistency with font, coloring, etc.
- [ ] Any images used should be sized appropriately and have alternative text displayed should the image fail to render
- [ ] You may use Bootstrap, PrimeNG, or any other CSS Framework you prefer or stick to writing your own CSS styles
- [ ] Collaboration with partners to meet required deliverables
- [ ] Proper use of GitHub Branches to maintain the versioning of your webpage

### **Bonus Challenge Ideas:**
- [ ] Add statistics to the webpage (ex. Chart.js)
- [ ] Assign users different roles with varying levels of application access (Spring Security)
- [ ] Add internationalization support for your app (ex. i18n or ngx-translate)
- [ ] Deploy the application using AWS
